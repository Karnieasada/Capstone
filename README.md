# Hank-Bot 
Hank-Bot is an automation application that records computer actions to allow a user to automate 
inputs to programs. It records the actions then outputs them as a Json file to later be read when the 
user wishes to play them back. The program also has a simple editor to edit and save the playback 
file in the case of errors. Thus, allowing an end user more power over the fine tuning of the recorded 
files.
