# Hank-Bot 
Hank-Bot is an automation application that records computer actions to allow a user to automate 
inputs to programs. It records the actions then outputs them as a Json file to later be read when the 
user wishes to play them back. The program also has a simple editor to edit and save the playback 
file in the case of errors. Thus, allowing an end user more power over the fine tuning of the recorded 
files.

### Prerequisites
There are no further prequisites required for running the software other than what is included in
the build folder.

### Installing
The executable file for the current build of the project is in the build folder [here](build)

You can find a simple tutorial video on the download and installation of the program [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_o-bEVHiZc&ab_channel=JeffreyHale). There are
further tutorial videos below of basic usage of the program in the tutorials section.
